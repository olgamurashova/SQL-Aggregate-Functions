1. Counting how many rows are in the table:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
WHERE price = 0;

2. Adding all the values in a particular column using SUM():

ELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM table_name;

3. Using The MAX() and MIN() functions to return the highest and lowest values in a column:

SELECT MIN(downloads)
FROM table_name;

SELECT MAX(price)
FROM table_name;

4. Calculating the average value of a particular column:

SELECT AVG(downloads)
FROM table_name;

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM table_name;

5. Rounding the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer:

SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM table_name;

SELECT name, ROUND(price, 0)
FROM table_name;

SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
FROM table_name;
