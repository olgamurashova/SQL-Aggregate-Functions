1. Counting how many rows are in the table:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
WHERE price = 0;

2. Adding all the values in a particular column using SUM():

ELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM table_name;

3. Using The MAX() and MIN() functions to return the highest and lowest values in a column:

SELECT MIN(downloads)
FROM table_name;

SELECT MAX(price)
FROM table_name;

4. Calculating the average value of a particular column:

SELECT AVG(downloads)
FROM table_name;

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM table_name;

5. Rounding the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified by the integer:

SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM table_name;

SELECT name, ROUND(price, 0)
FROM table_name;

SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
FROM table_name;

6. Arranging identical data into groups:

SELECT year,
   AVG(imdb_rating)
FROM movies
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;

SELECT price, COUNT(*)
from table_name
GROUP by price;

SELECT price, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
WHERE downloads > 20000
GROUP BY price;

SELECT category, SUM(downloads)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY category;

7. Grouping by data:

SELECT category, 
   price,
   AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY 1, 2;

8. Grouping data using HAVING clause:

SELECT year,
   genre,
   COUNT(name)
FROM movies
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING COUNT(name) > 10;

SELECT price, 
   ROUND(AVG(downloads)),
   COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps
GROUP BY price
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;
